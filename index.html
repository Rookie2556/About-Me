    Hey, I am Thomsa Moore - I am currently doing a Cern stack course with techEducators.
    
    I am 21 years old, 01/01 baby haha!
    
    <li> I've gone through 2 years of computer science in university then decided it wasn't for me, and since then have gotten my forklifting certification
      and now a software engineering qualifications! </li>
    
    <li> I did GCSEs and A levels Computer science </li> 
    
    I'm based in Liverpool and my favourite colour is green (well, I'm one of **those** people who think their favourite colour is based
    off whatever the thing is, e.g. I wouldn't own a green pc.
    
    I've worked as: 
    <li> a food courier for a summer </li>
    <li> production line for two summers </li>
    <li> house cleaning/gardening throughout my high school
      years with my father. </li>
    <li> Cadets for 2 years </li>
    <li> Coding club TA for a year </li>
    
    I did do work experience with Liverpool city council for about 2 weeks and found that enjoyable, it encouraged me to do computing through 
    high school.
