    Hey, I am Thomsa Moore - I am currently doing a Cern stack course with techEducators.
    
    I am 21 years old, 01/01 baby haha!
    
    I've gone through 2 years of computer science in university then decided it wasn't for me, and since then have gotten my forklifting certification
    and now a software engineering qualifications! 
    
    I'm based in Liverpool and my favourite colour is green (well, I'm one of **those** people who think their favourite colour is based
    off whatever the thing is, e.g. I wouldn't own a green pc.
    
    I've worked as a food courier for a summer, production line for two summers and house cleaning/gardening throughout my high school
    years with my father. 
    
    I did do work experience with Liverpool city council for about 2 weeks and found that enjoyable, it encouraged me to do computing through 
    high school.
